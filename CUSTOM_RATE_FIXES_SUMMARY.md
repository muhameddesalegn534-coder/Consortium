# Custom Rate Handling Fixes Summary

## Problem
When the "Use custom exchange rate" checkbox was checked in financial_report_section.php, the system was not properly using custom rates for transactions. Instead, it was using database-stored rates, and the `use_custom_rate` flag was not being set to 1 in budget_preview.

## Root Cause
In ajax_handler.php, when updating the budget_data table, the code was using `$amount` (converted with default rates) instead of `$amountInBudgetCurrency` (converted with custom rates if applicable).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ajax_handler.php - save_transaction function
- **Issue**: Used `$amount` instead of `$amountInBudgetCurrency` for budget updates
- **Fix**: Changed to use `$amountInBudgetCurrency` which properly handles custom rates
- **Location**: Line ~400 in the save_transaction function

### 2. ajax_handler.php - delete_transaction function
- **Issue**: Not properly handling custom rates for rollback operations
- **Fix**: Added proper custom rate handling by:
  1. Retrieving custom rate information from the database
  2. Using those rates for currency conversion
  3. Applying the converted amount to budget updates
- **Location**: Lines ~870-890 in the delete_transaction function

### 3. delete_transaction.php
- **Status**: Already correctly implemented custom rate handling
- **Features**:
  - Retrieves custom rate information from the database
  - Uses those rates for currency conversion
  - Applies the converted amount to budget updates

### 4. edit_transaction.php
- **Status**: Correctly handles custom rates for display and conversion
- **Features**:
  - Retrieves custom rate information from the database
  - Uses those rates for currency conversion during edits

## Verification
All files now properly:
1. Use custom rates when the "Use custom exchange rate" checkbox is checked
2. Fall back to database-stored rates when custom rates are not enabled
3. Set the `use_custom_rate` flag to 1 in budget_preview when custom rates are used
4. Store custom rate values in the database for future reference
5. Use the same custom rates for rollback operations when deleting transactions

## Testing
To verify the fixes work correctly:
1. Enable custom rates for a cluster
2. Create a transaction with custom rates enabled
3. Verify that the transaction uses custom rates and sets `use_custom_rate` to 1
4. Delete the transaction and verify that the rollback uses the same custom rates
5. Verify that all budget calculations are correct

The system now properly handles custom currency rates in all transaction operations.
