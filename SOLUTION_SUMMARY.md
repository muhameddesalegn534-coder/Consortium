# Solution Summary: Precision Loss Issue with 20,000 ETB Transaction

## Problem
When saving a 20,000 ETB transaction, the system was storing 19,999.82 instead of the exact amount. This was caused by precision loss during currency conversion operations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Database Schema**: Financial fields were using `decimal(18,2)` which limits precision to 2 decimal places
2. **Currency Conversion**: The system was converting amounts from ETB to another currency and back, causing precision loss even with floating-point arithmetic
3. **Number Formatting**: PHP's number formatting was limiting precision in error messages and calculations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Updated decimal precision for financial fields:
- `budget_preview` table: Changed from `decimal(18,2)` to `decimal(18,10)` for monetary fields
- `budget_data` table: Changed from `decimal(18,2)` to `decimal(18,10)` for monetary fields
- `currency_rates` table: Changed from `decimal(10,4)` to `decimal(18,8)` for exchange rates

### 2. Currency Conversion Logic Fixes
Added special handling in `ajax_handler.php` to prevent precision loss:

#### a. Save Transaction Function
```php
// Convert amount from ETB to target currency
$amount = convertCurrency($amountETB, 'ETB', $targetCurrency, $currencyRates);

// SPECIAL FIX: If target currency is ETB, preserve the exact user input to avoid precision loss
if ($targetCurrency === 'ETB') {
    $amount = $amountETB;
}
```

#### b. Budget Comparison Logic
```php
// Convert the entered amount to the same currency as the budget for comparison
$amountInBudgetCurrency = convertCurrency($amountETB, 'ETB', $budgetCurrency, $currencyRates);

// SPECIAL FIX: If budget currency is ETB, preserve the exact user input to avoid precision loss
if ($budgetCurrency === 'ETB') {
    $amountInBudgetCurrency = $amountETB;
}
```

#### c. Delete Transaction Function
```php
// Convert the original transaction amount to the budget currency using the same rates that were used when adding
$amountInBudgetCurrency = convertCurrency($amount, $transactionCurrency, $budgetCurrency, $currencyRates);

// SPECIAL FIX: If budget currency is same as transaction currency, preserve the exact amount to avoid precision loss
if ($budgetCurrency === $transactionCurrency) {
    $amountInBudgetCurrency = $amount;
}
```

### 3. Code Updates
- Updated number formatting to use 10 decimal places for internal calculations
- Kept display formatting at 2 decimal places for user interface
- Added `formatCurrencyHighPrecision()` function for high-precision formatting

## Verification
Created test scripts to verify the fixes:
1. `test_precision_fix.php` - Tests currency conversion precision and database field types
2. `update_budget_preview_decimal_precision.php` - Updates budget_preview table precision
3. `update_budget_data_decimal_precision.php` - Updates budget_data table precision
4. `update_currency_rates_decimal_precision.php` - Updates currency_rates table precision

## Expected Results
After implementing these fixes:
- A 20,000 ETB transaction will be stored as exactly 20,000.0000000000 in the database
- No precision loss will occur when the target currency is the same as the input currency
- Financial calculations will maintain higher precision
- User interface will still display amounts with 2 decimal places for readability

## Implementation Steps
1. Run the database update scripts:
   ```
   php update_budget_preview_decimal_precision.php
   php update_budget_data_decimal_precision.php
   php update_currency_rates_decimal_precision.php
   ```

2. The code fixes are already implemented in the source files

3. Verify the fixes by running:
   ```
   php test_precision_fix.php
   ```

4. Test by creating a new 20,000 ETB transaction and checking the database

## Benefits
- Eliminates precision loss for same-currency transactions
- Improves accuracy of financial calculations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Preserves user interface consistency
